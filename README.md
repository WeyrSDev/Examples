Examples
========

Every now and then I sit down and tryout some features of some library or even C++ itself or since I'm quite active in the official SFML forum I end up writing the same example code over and over again.
So instead of letting those code fragments go to waste on my computer or in the SFML forum I decided to put them openly and centralized here on GitHub for everyone to see, share and learn from them.
